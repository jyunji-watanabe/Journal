## What I learned
### Can Exceptions caused by Server Request Timeout be handled by Exception Handler inside Service Actions?
Yes. The message should be "A task was canceled". As is to be expected, A client side Exception Handler can handle the Excetpion too.
If the Service Action calls another Server Action and the Timeout is occurred during its runtime, AllExceptions Handler inside that Server Action can handle it.

### We can write SQLs against External Entities in ODC
https://www.outsystems.com/product-updates/sql-external-entities/

[Understand ANSI-92 syntax in SQL nodes](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/building_apps/data_management/fetch_data_from_the_database_in_outsystems/query_data_using_sql/understand_ansi_92_syntax_in_sql_nodes/)
Here's the docmentation for the new feature.

> ANSI-92 is a syntax that helps you write portable, consistent SQL designed to work with all the external systems connected via Data Fabric.

Is this available for not only external databases but external services like salesforce?

The queries we input will be converted by ODC to respective dialoct of external systems.
