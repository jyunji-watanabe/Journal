## React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)
### Section 7: Debugging React Apps
126-130
Coding Exercise 20
- React's Strict Mode
- React DevTools

According to the course video, we can add breapoints directly to our React code. Maybe it is not possible for OutSystems Apps? I will check it later.

StrictMode is a component from 'react', usually imported at the start of the index.jsx file.
It is meant to wrap another component like <StrictMode><App /> </SctirctMode>
Inside these components wrapped with StrictMode, functions will be called twice

React Developer Tools will add new tabs to the Developer
The tool requires access all the data on all the web sites. It seems that we can restrict which page it can access by setting. I think "On select" is prefereble.

### Section 8: Working with Refs & Portals
131-141
Coding Exercise 21, 22, 23

- Refs to simplify access DOM Elements directly
- Managing Values with Refs
- Exposing API Functions from Components
- Detaching DOM Rendering from JSX Structure with Portals

React Fragment: being used to work as a wrapper tag as the only one root JSX element whilst at the same time not rendering any DOM element.
<Fragment></Fragment> or in some settings (like Vite) <></>

The variable gotten by useRef is alwasy an object of connected element and has current property
When ref is updated, the component function does not re-execute unlike in the case of state.
When ref is connected with a tag, ref is the tag object
