# OutSystems
## New
A Release Note from OutSystems Developer Cloud 2025-03-27 says "It is now possible to filter settings and REST consume configurations by library or main application in the App detail page on the ODC Portal. (RDLOT-3449)".

When accessing App detail page of ODC Portal, and then opening Configuration > Settings, I could see "Search settin" UI on one tenant.
Hoever, on another tenant I can't see the UI. Maybe there is some settings for a tenant to enable this feature.
